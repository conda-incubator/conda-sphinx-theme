# Contributing

The conda-sphinx-theme is a community maintained project. We welcome contributions in the form of bug reports,
documentation, code, design proposals, and more.

## Installing the theme itself:

To install the theme and begin developing locally, run the following command in an isolated environment:

`python -m pip install -e .`

After that you will be able to build the docs locally by doing `make html` in the `docs` directory.
